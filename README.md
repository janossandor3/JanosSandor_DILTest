# JanosSandor_DILTest

Hello,

For the first part of the task I created a real pull request review, instead of just collecting some ideas about making the given code better. As the pull request is not that readable because of the 46 comments, I copied the comments in "part1_commented" file too. In the "MySolution" folder I tried wanted to show how I would have done that code.

The second part for the Ghost Drawing App I uploaded the whole project as a zip file, the main view controller's xib and swift file and a video to show how it works for me.

Thank you!
Janos
